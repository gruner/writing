quip: What can brown do for you?

Everyone knows that you're not supposed to feed chocolate to dogs and cats. The official reason is that it will make them sick. This is an obvious lie. We're just afraid, on an almost subconscious level, that once animals develop a taste for chocolate they will collectively overthrow our society. Hence this myth that it somehow makes them "sick".
