At work we have one of the popular (so I'm told) Philips Senseo coffee makers, and every time I walk by it in the lunch room I feel sorry for it because it looks so sad!

For something that has caffeine filtered through it several times a day I'm not sure why it's so down. It looks like it's mourning over something, as if there were a dead kitten sprawled over its cup tray.

Like Marvin the depressed robot in _The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy_, maybe it's contemplating the intricacies of the universe, sorry it's stuck in such a menial job serving coffee to humans who don't appreciate it.

I'm not sure why its makers designed it this way. But even its name, _Senseo_, suggests that it's prone to emotional breakdown.

The design of a coffee maker should imply a cheerful outlook and appear perky and cute, like an energetic little helper monkey. Not a sullen Emo-bot, which looks like it would spit in your cup when you're not looking.
