I spend altogether _way_ too much time in front of the computer. In fact, I've considered taking up smoking as a way of getting myself up and away from the desk at regular intervals.

It'd be really nice to go outside and get some fresh air throughout the day, and a nicotine addiction would give me the incentive and structure to ensure following through with a new discipline.

I know it's not a huge step towards self improvement, but everything I've read says it's important to take small steps towards a healthier lifestyle. Plus it would make me look cool.
