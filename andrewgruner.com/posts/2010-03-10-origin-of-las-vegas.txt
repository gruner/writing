It all started with a man and a large refrigerator box. He cut a small hole in the cardboard, stood inside, and asked people outside on the street if they would like to put money through the hole on the chance that he might decide to give it back to them.

One day a curious person stopped in front of the box and put a dollar inside. "Are you going to give my dollar back to me?" said the person. The man in the box thought about it for a few seconds and said, "Sorry but I'm keeping it." But another person came along and put a dollar in the box, and the man inside decided to give it *back* to him. "Here is your dollar back, thanks for stopping by," he said. People kept coming to his box to try their luck by putting money inside. Sometimes he would keep it and sometimes he would give it back. (But he ended up keeping a lot more money than he gave back.)

Sometimes, though not very often, he would even give back more money than the person originally gave him! "Congratulations, I'm giving you some of the money I took from all the other people," he would tell them. (But he still kept most of the money for himself.)

For some strange reason, many people found this to be a worthwhile activity!

Every week the man would take some of his earnings and decorate his box a little bit. At first he painted some eye-catching colors on it. A few weeks later he glued some glitter and rhinestones to the box. He was able to set up other boxes and hire people to work in them. As time went on he kept making his boxes more flashy and elaborate, attracting more and more people to come by and give him their money, most of which he kept.

Suckers.
