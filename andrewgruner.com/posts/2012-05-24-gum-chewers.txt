What is wrong with you?!

Where exactly do you think your gum is going? You realize that someone else is going to have to fish it out of the fountain and throw it away, don't you? It's not like it's going to dissolve over the next few hours and melt away into the drain. It's just going to sit there and wait until someone, probably the janitor because everyone else is too grossed out by it, picks it out of the drain and throws it away. Do you realize that if anyone else wants a drink now they have to put their face four inches away from your half-eaten food?

What is wrong with you?
