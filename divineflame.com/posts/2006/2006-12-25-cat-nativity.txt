The catalog's cover features a "[Cat Nativity](http://www.collectionsetc.com/Item76132.aspx?alias=3867676132)". The set depicts the classic nativity scene, with all the main players represented by anthropomorphic cats, with an adorable sleeping kitty representing the Newborn King. What's next, a kittyfied Jesus on the cross?
