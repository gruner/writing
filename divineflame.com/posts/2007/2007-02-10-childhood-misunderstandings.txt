When I was little, before I could read, I thought that the line in the Lord's Prayer "And lead us not into temptation" was actually "And lead _a snot_ into temptation". By my child logic it stood to reason that because snot is usually undesirable we were asking God to bring a spirit of snottiness unto whatever would try and lead us astray.

I thought it was strange that everyone rattled this line off every week in church, but that I'd be asked to change topics whenever my conversations became preoccupied with this bodily substance.

When you're a kid, you're forced to accept a lot of things that don't make any sense. You think you'll understand better when you grow up. I'm still waiting for that to happen.
