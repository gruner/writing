> When I was a child, I talked like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child. When I became a man, I put childish ways behind me. _1 Corinthians 13:11 (NIV)_

I recently came across [I Used To Believe](http://www.iusedtobelieve.com), a site full of the strange and humorous ideas people remember from childhood. I was surprised that so many similar fantastic ideas are arrived at independently among children. I never really realized that child logic, which is such a separate and independent form of cognition, would deduce so many similarities between individuals.

Here are a few of my own childhood ideas that I recalled while browsing the site:

* Reports of **Guerilla Warfare** on the news conjured images of soldiers fighting armed gorillas in the jungle.
* The television PSA's against **Drinking & Driving** pertained to any drink, and I scolded my mom for drinking a Pepsi in the car.
* Every intersection in the city had a control room beneath the street filled with municipal employees whose job was to monitor the traffic and change the stop lights accordingly.
