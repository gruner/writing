title: Devine Misspellings

Jennifer and I are continually surprised to discover how many people can't spell "divine". They think it's spelled "devine". If we had researched it more carefully I'm not sure we would have settled on the name Divine Flame.

But we both really like the name and it's a bit too late to change now even if we wanted to.

So we ended up paying for the domain name [DevineFlame.com](http://www.devineflame.com) and setting it up to forward to this site.

I was tempted to set up a temporary message like, "Dude, learn to spell," but I hate it when other sites do this. Earlier today I went to [Kinkos' site](http://kinkos.com) where I was informed that the URL is now _FedEx_ Kinkos. Oh, sorry. I guess I'm supposed to learn the intricacies of your rebranding strategy.<sup id='fnr1-2008-01-28'><a href="#fn1-2008-01-28">1</a></sup>

I think this is a heavy-handed approach and comes off as snooty. A web site should be as seamless to the user as possible and compensate for easily anticipated errors. And so that's what we've opted for.

But seriously, dude. Learn to spell.

<p>This is ironic coming from a company that adapted it's identity from <em>Federal Express</em> to <em>FedEx</em> because the nickname had already stuck.<a href="#fnr1-2008-01-28" class='footnote_back_link' title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text.">&#8617;</a></p>
