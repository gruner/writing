Things are changing. In less than two months Jennifer and I are having a baby. (Our first, and a girl. We're very excited). Accordingly, we've spent the last several months shifting gears towards becoming parents.<!--more--> This, obviously, has impacted our time, attention, and financial obligation to Divine Flame, which had previously been our "baby".

We're still dedicated to creative faith expression but t-shirts probably won't be available any time soon.

## American Apparel

Pregnancy notwithstanding, we ran into a snag when we realized that we couldn't in good faith work with a company like American Apparel, who was going to be our source for blank t-shirts. Although they have some values that we want to support, like fair wages and working conditions, the rest of their company image is, frankly, [embarrassing to be associated with](http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/14082498/). So we're still looking for a blank t-shirt supplier that is American made but not so hoochie.

## Curriculum

Another shift in gears is that we would like to start offering downloadable curriculum for youth groups of all sizes. Jennifer is currently developing the materials which will make planning youth events and devotions super easy. We're calling it Instant Youth Ministry.

So we're still searching and praying for direction, but confident that God will use our gifts as he sees fit.
