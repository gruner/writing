Wow, it's been a few years. Sorry about that. I'm hoping to invest more in this site now. I've added a section for [illustrations](/illustration) to show some paintings I've been working on with more on the way. I won't go into too much detail about future plans right now because it really sucks to say something is coming soon and then not be able to deliver on it.

The good news is that even after several years, I'm still pretty happy with the site design as it stands, so I don't feel obliged to spend a lot of time doing a redesign of it. It's much more fun to be able to focus on creating new things than constantly revising old ones.

I'm trying to keep focused on Christian art, design, and culture, and to that end I've pruned a lot of old blog posts that are no longer relevant.

Stay tuned...
