I tried something new as I painted this illustration. I wanted to paint the details in a specific order so that the progression would tell a story of sorts, and reinforce the message of the final image. I started with an empty background and the character praying in middle, all alone. Then the tubes and pipes slowly grow and morph around him until finally they surrounding him, screaming in unison for attention.

## Some Notes

The phone in the picture was originally going to be an old-timey stock ticker. I changed it at the advice of my wife, who convinced me that no one would know what it was supposed to be. (Although it won't be much longer before rotary phones are in the same boat.)

I took the photos for the initial stages with my phone, so the quality is not as good as the image of the final version.

Here's the [finished illustration](/illustration/series-of-tubes). <!--It's also available [for sale as a print](http://store.divineflame.com/products/series-of-tubes).-->
