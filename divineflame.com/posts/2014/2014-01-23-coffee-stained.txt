Like most adults in the Pacific Northwest you've grown a fondness/addiction for coffee. After realizing the enormous cost of daily trips to Starbucks you decided to experiment with home brewing. You carefully research the [best techniques](http://en-us.reddit.com/r/coffee) and purchase the [best equipment](#) for storing fresh roasted beans, grinding them, and brewing the perfect cup of coffee. You learn that the delicate flavors in coffee come from the aromatic oils in the beans, and that carefully teasing out these oils at the right time is the essence of good coffee.

But these same oils have a volatile nature, permeating anything they come in contact with. Use a thermos for coffee just one time and you will find it very difficult to remove the essence of coffee left behind. If you want something to not taste or smell like coffee it has to be kept separate from anything related to coffee making or consumption. And the more coffee you have in the kitchen, the harder you have to work to keep it segregated from everything else.

You're not a preacher but you can see a huge object lesson here about holiness. You're to live a life that is separate from the corrupting influence of the world. You have to keep yourself separated so that God can use you to do His work. You're a vessel that God wants desperately to fill. He has great things planned for you but you have to keep yourself from smelling and tasting like the rest of the world.
