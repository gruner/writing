Children have a unique way of forming conclusions from their limited knowledge that are very logical but can often be very far from the truth. These misconceptions usually end up being pretty funny too. These are things I thought about Star Wars as a kid.

## Yoda was a Very Old Human

When Yoda tells Luke that, "When 900 years old you reach, look as good you will not" it made me think that the Jedi have exceptionally long life spans. Old people get shorter and their ears get proportionally bigger as they age, so Yoda is the result of this process happening over hundreds of years.

Another allusion to long life is when Jabba describes the Sarlac as slowly digesting its victims "over a thousand years". This led me to believe that the person would be alive and in torture for this whole period of time. It seemed that the people in Star Wars had very long life spans.

## Darth Vader's Conversion

Darth Vader was turned into a machine slowly, piece by piece, as he lost different body parts in various lightsaber duels through the years. Luke's lost hand is replaced with a robotic one, so this seemed to be a common occupational hazard for the Jedi. Darth Vader had just been in so many fights that he kept having body parts replaced until the scales tipped and he became "more machine than man", thus losing his humanity.
