Cold foods and beverages have less flavor than warm ones. To make good ice tea you have to make it with double the amount of tea you'd use when you make it hot. You also have to brew it concentrated because you'll be diluting it with lots of ice if you want to drink it right away. So, brew half as much, but twice as strong.
