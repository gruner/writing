title: Rules For Helping You Move

1. We're not moving trash. Throw it out now, don't haul it to the new place.

2. Don't move more than once a year. If you do, don't ask the same friends to help you.

3. Do everything possible to finish packing BEFORE moving day. We don't have time to stand around watching you fill boxes.

4. Packing is not sorting. Sorting it a thoughtful and time-consuming process. You don't have time for that now. Just get your stuff in boxes. (unless it's trash, see #1)
