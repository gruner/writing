I'm convinced that if there's ever virtual reality at the level seen in _The Matrix_ that everything technological will just reset itself by several generations. We might have a completely convincing alternate world, but it will take time before all of our current technology can be converted or replicated in the virtual world. There will be a lag time.

In other words, the virtual reality edition of Photoshop will be a simulation of a darkroom, where you'll develop and manipulate your digital photos with simulated chemicals and negative projectors. Even worse, the virtual reality edition of InDesign will be a simulation of a 14th Century printing press.

We've already seen similar patterns of technological repetition. Video games started with simple black and white graphics, and progressed through Atari, then 8-bit NES, all the way up to today's game systems. In a similar way iPods went through the same cycle starting with a grayscale interface…

cell phones started with greyscale screens, then color, then you can play crappy games on them. iPods started with greyscale screens, then color, now you can play crappy games on them. Every new device follows the same pattern of progression.

Internet, graphics, animated gifs, flash comes along and all of a suddenly everyone is mesmerized by simple moving shapes again.

The internet is born --- Then Facebook comes along and feels obligated to reinvent the wheel. It becomes a miniature internet with it's own form of homepage and email.

[social networking sites are now creating their own versions of existing technologies, such as email, IM, and chat, creating a layer of similar functionality on top of an existing functional system, basically reinventing the wheel.
