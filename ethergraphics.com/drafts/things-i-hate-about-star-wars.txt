## The Prequel Concept

I've grown weary of the prequel as a storytelling device, mainly because of how it taints the original. I don't think this problem is unique to Star Wars but is inherent to what a prequel actually is. Unless it's the author's intent, how could it not alter the way you view the original? The original Star Wars is so great because it's full of mystery. Who are these Jawa creatures capturing R2?

Prequels also take too many liberties with connections between characters. Why does Anakin have to be C-3PO’s maker? It doesn't seem relevant to the story. Why does Yoda have to be friends with Chewbacca? Too many of these cutesy connections and you’ve just created Muppet Babies. I'm surprised there wasn't a toddler Han Solo running around in a black vest somewhere in a background shot.

## Midichlorians

When Episode 1 introduced the concept of midichlorians I thought it was setting up a biological element to the Force that would latter become an important component of the Clone Wars. Nope, never referenced again. This only serves to take the mysticism out of the force, again deflating the original. Thanks, George!

## The Pregnancy

In ROTS Anakin has a vision of Padmé dying in child birth. Does he take her to a doctor or anything? She's a Senator living on the most affluent planet in the Republic, you'd think she would have access to some kick-ass prenatal care, right? Plus, wouldn't it be natural to assume that Anakin would use the force to examine the unborn child? Especially if he was having troubling dreams about his wife dying in childbirth?  Which leads to the question, why didn't anyone know that Padmé was carrying twins? Did she know? Was she keeping it from him? None of this is explained.

And then as soon as the twins are born Padme dies, not from any medical complications, but of a broken heart. A mother who’s just given birth has nothing to live for?! Contrast that to Princess Leia who sees her home planet blown up, is tortured in the first two movies, and is subjugated as Jabba's slave girl. It really makes you despise Padmé for being such a weak and selfish person.

## Ben & R2

In ANH does Obi-Wan recognize R2-D2 or not? He appears not to, and tells Luke that he, “doesn't seem to remember ever owning any droid.” Even though he always had an astromech on his Jedi fighter. (But technically might not have “owned” them.) If yes then he’s lying to Luke even more than when he tells him his father was killed. The more he’s lying, the less likable he is. If he's not lying then he's going senile. He mentions R2 several times in the prequels.

## Leia’s Memories of Her Mother

In ROTJ Luke asks Leia if she remembers their birth mother, and she tells him about some faint memories she still has. But thanks to ROTS we find out that these aren't real memories, but are apparently just some residual psychic force recollections. Nice.
