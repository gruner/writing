Jennifer is out of town for the weekend. When I mention this to anyone, they always respond by saying, "So, you're a bachelor for a few days." They say it in jest but I always sense some underlying fear, as if they worry I might revert to some primordial invertebrate state and all my wife's hard work will be lost.

Their fear is unfounded. I always manage to clean up the beer bottles and pizza boxes before she gets back.
