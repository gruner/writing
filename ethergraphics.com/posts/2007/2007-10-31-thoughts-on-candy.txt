Where do artificial fruit flavors come from? How did they become standardized? Artificial cherry tastes nothing like cherries yet this flavor has been accepted across many forms, be it candy, gum, juice, popsicles, or jello. The same with strawberry, grape, orange, and many others.

Was there some kind of Artificial Fruit-Flavor Consortium in the early 20th Century, a think-tank that developed the formulas that we've now come to know, love, and crave? How come I've never heard of this momentous event of human achievement?

Also, I subscribe to the theory that all candy corn ever made was produced in a single batch sometime in the 1930’s and sits in a warehouse until it’s divvied out a little each October.
