I'm fascinated with the concept of bartering. It would be cool if I could use my skills in direct trade to the things I need from other people. I think that with only slight changes to what we've grown accustomed to that bartering could make a comeback.

If someone didn't directly need my skill, but I was in frequent trade with someone else, I could trade for extra items and earn a surplus with the other person, and then trade the surplus with people who need it, but don't necessarily need my services. To make it simpler we could create physical "barter credits" and trade them back and forth rather than hauling actual items around.

Then I think bartering could really take off.
