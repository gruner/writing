If I were a lot more outgoing and not horrified by public speaking I would consider becoming a cover comedian of Jerry Seinfeld's work. I often wonder why there are no cover comedians. What am I talking about? A cover comedian would be similar to a cover band. It's not an impersonation of the comic, but an interpretation or tribute to their stand-up material.
