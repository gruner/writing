Inside of a crowded subway train a man opens his coat to peak at the Heritage Dr. Pepper bottle tucked inside his pocket. Suddenly, another man in the train car goes into convulsions and falls to the ground. The fallen man's wife, squatting down next to him looks up at the crowd and pleads, "He's a diabetic and he's gone into shock. Does anyone have any **sugar**?" Someone offers a can of generic soda but she refuses it saying, "No, this is corn syrup. He needs real sugar!" (the other dude looks again at the bottle before closing his coat again).

Heritage Dr. Pepper  
Made with real sugar

But it's OK to share.
