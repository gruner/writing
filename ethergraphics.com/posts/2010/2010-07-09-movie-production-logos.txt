title: Movie Production Logos

It seems like every movie you see in the theater is preceded by at least two or three animated logos of the companies that produced the movie. Jerry Bruckheimer's logo speeds us down a winding road as lightning fills the sky. Pixar has their cute little Luxo lamp bouncing on the letter 'I'.

These logos seem to get fancier and more elaborate every year. Now they're almost becoming little self-contained short films. In fact they're getting so impressive that I've started thinking, "Wow, if the logo is this cool the movie is gonna be _awesome!_"

If I were to start a production company I'd call it _And That's Just the Logo Productions_. Then our fancy animated logo would prance all over the screen followed by the words "And That's Just the Logo". I think that would set the proper tone for the awesomeness about to occur.
