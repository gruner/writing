A miniature movie theater that the iPhone plugs into, becoming the movie screen. You'd wear it as a hat to create an immersive theater experience while watching videos on the iPhone (when absolutely no one else is around). It could even be done as a novelty paper cutout giveaway or something equally ephemeral.
