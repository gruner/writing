title: How I Listen to Music

I'll listen to a new album about 50 times over a 6 week period. After that the music will be so indelibly tied to a specific point in my life that listening to it at a later date is like opening a time capsule. Good or bad, it feels awkward to try to listen to it on its own, and it's spoiled a lot of good music.
