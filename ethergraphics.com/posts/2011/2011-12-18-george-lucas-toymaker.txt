"I had always envisioned Star Wars as a massive line of action figures and accessories. I developed the film and its characters in such a way as to be easily transferred to popular toys. I created the outer space setting for the story in order to be able to produce fantastic and memorable vehicles, ships, and playsets for the toy line. As a child I always enjoyed playing with toys and accessories from popular movie serials like *Buck Rogers* and I wanted the children of today to be able to have a similar experience with their toys.

As a marketer I was frustrated with the toy making technology that existed at the time. But we released the first line of Star Wars action figures in 1978 and were overwhelmed by their popularity. At that time no other manufacturer had produced a toy line like that. We were very cutting edge in spite of our modest technology.

Then in the early nineties I had a chance to tour a manufacturing facility in China. I was amazed at the breakthroughs they had achieved in toy making. It was then that I decided that the technology was finally available to produce the kind of toys I had originally envisioned for Star Wars.

I was no longer limited by external factors and was finally able to fulfill my original vision."
