title: How to Brew Perfect Iced Tea

I'm not a foodie, and I don't know if this is a principle of cooking, but I find that cold foods and beverages have less flavor than warm ones.

So to brew good iced tea you have to make it stronger than when it's hot, using double the amount of dry tea you'd normally use. You also have to brew it concentrated because you'll be diluting it with lots of ice. So, brew half as much, but twice as strong. I usually use two tea bags (or two teaspoons of loose leaf) and one cup of boiling water, steeping for the normal amount of time.

Fill a large glass with as much ice as it will hold and pour the hot concentrated brew over it. Stir it for a minute, add a small slice of lemon (not a wedge), and you're done.
