Last night I knocked over a glass of water and it soaked a coloring page that my daughter had left on the table. I didn't know how attached she was to it so I didn't just throw it away. Instead I let it dry over night hoping it could be salvaged. This morning I was amazed at how beautifully the marker colors had bled together. I'm going to have to steal this technique.
