Regardless of the activity, I find it fascinating to watch an expert at work. For that reason I keep watching this calligraphy video. I always think of calligraphy as a slow and delicate craft, but this guy scratches out letters in a series of quick precise strokes, like an expert samurai. There's so much confidence in it. (It gets good around minute two.)
