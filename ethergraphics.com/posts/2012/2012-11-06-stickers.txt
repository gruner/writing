It amazes me that people don't take the stickers off of their computers. It's hard not to see it as a matter of bad taste, but to me it's no different than the little vinyl cling stickers on a pair of sunglasses, and as far as I know everyone removes those. (It's not like it's an [asinine fashion statement](http://www.google.com/search?q=59fifty+hat+stickers) or something.)
