I finally got a chance to see Prometheus. I wanted so badly to see it over the summer but the timing never worked out, then I forgot about it until it came out on disc. I'm glad I didn't pay to see it in the theater, because I didn't like it at all.

Every single character was extremely selfish and/or stupid to the point that I didn't care about any of them. The pacing felt all wrong – there was an urgency to keep moving the plot forward when the story didn't necessitate it. The story itself was convoluted and didn't make much sense either – there were all kinds of different permutations of aliens with no explanation of how they all suposedly relate. I've heard of a possible sequel that would give more answers, but I don't really care at this point. Mystery and suspense are more than just presenting random ambiguities and withholding the information on how it's supposed to fit together.

I expected a tighter film from Ridley Scott. Does every sci-fi movie series need an execrable prequel?
