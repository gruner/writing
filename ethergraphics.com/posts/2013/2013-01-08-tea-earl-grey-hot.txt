I love Earl Grey tea. One of my favorite blends is from Teavana. It has a really strong bergamot flavor. However, I'm not sure I like Teavana anymore, especially how their salespeople operate. Whenever I go in to purchase Earl Grey they try and push their much more pricey White Earl Grey, which costs five times more than the standard. In fact, whenever I inquire about a specific tea, they try and push one of their premium products on me. It's so transparent it's ridiculous.

Moreover, when they measure the tea you order, they always go over. ("Oops, is three ounces OK?") You're telling me that you measure tea all day long and you haven't learned how to reasonably estimate two ounces? I'm close to going on a quest for a better Earl Grey so that I'm not beholden to these neck-tattooed jerks.
